# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning 👁️🧠

This project uses deep learning to detect **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** from retinal fundus images.  
An **EfficientNet-B3 Ensemble Model** is trained on a large Kaggle dataset with advanced techniques such as **class-balanced sampling, fine-tuning, data augmentation & focal loss** to handle class imbalance.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

| Model | Technique | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Model A | EfficientNet-B3 + Class Weights | Strong baseline |
| Model B | EfficientNet-B3 + Focal Loss | Better learning on minority classes |
| Ensemble | Soft voting of both models | Stable + Higher accuracy |

📊 Final Test Accuracy: **66%**  
*(Improved performance on Mild, Moderate & Severe DR cases)*
